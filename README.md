# Weather Prediction Using Hybrid Model

## Project Overview
This repository contains a **weather and rainfall prediction system implemented using machine learning techniques** in Jupyter Notebooks. The project focuses on analyzing historical weather data, performing exploratory analysis, and building a **hybrid prediction model** to capture complex patterns present in weather data.

The objective is to improve predictive performance by combining multiple modeling approaches rather than relying on a single model.

## Problem Statement
Weather prediction is a challenging task due to noise, seasonality, and non-linear relationships in meteorological data. Traditional single-model approaches often fail to generalize well.  
This project explores a **hybrid machine learning approach** to better model historical weather patterns and improve rainfall prediction accuracy.
